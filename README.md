AI Travel Planner for Students
Overview

AI Travel Planner for Students is a Generative AI-based web application that helps students create personalized and budget-friendly travel itineraries.

The system generates structured, day-wise travel plans based on user inputs such as destination, budget, number of days, interests, and travel style.

The application is built using Python, Streamlit, and Google AI Studio (Gemini API).

Problem Statement:

Travel planning is often time-consuming and expensive, especially for students with limited budgets and fixed schedules.

Most travel platforms provide generic recommendations that do not consider financial constraints, trip duration, or individual interests. Students need structured and optimized itineraries that align with their budget and preferences.

This project addresses that gap by generating customized travel plans tailored specifically for students.
